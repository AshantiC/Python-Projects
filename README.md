# Beginner Python Project

This repository is a collection of exercises and projects to help me learn Python. I'll keep adding more exercises as I learn new concepts.

## Current Exercises
1. **Hello World**: My first Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **Variables**: Learning how to declare and use variables of different types.
3. **Control Flow**: Working with `if` statements, `else`, and loops.
4. **Functions**: Learning how to define and call functions.

## Future Learning Goals
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python
- Working with files and directories
- Building a simple command-line application
- Web development with Flask/Django
