An HTML document consists of 2 important parts:
Documents Creation(what the user see)
Tags(and how they will set it)

Tag<html> is considered to be the head of the family
    From this tage that the browser recognizes, its an html document
    for every open tag there is a closing tag like </html>

However, the <html> is followed by the <head> tag
    <head> is a special one, and the content written inside is not displayed on the webpage
        it comprises of the tilte(of the browser window) or any other instructions, which you want
        to provide to the web browser

    For Example:
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to the jungle!!</title>
    </head>
    The <head> tag is followed by the <body> tag, where the actual content that is 
    visible on the webpage is written.
    i.e. all the visual elements such as headings, paragraphs, images
